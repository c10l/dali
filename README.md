# Tail logstash TCP output

`Dali` is a command-line utility that taps to a [Logstash](http://logstash.net/) [TCP output](http://logstash.net/docs/1.4.0/outputs/tcp) and prints formatted log lines to the console.

Originally I was going to call it `tailstash` as it is a tool that tails logstash's output. Instead, it's named after the famous Spanish painter because of his infamous tail-looking moustache.
